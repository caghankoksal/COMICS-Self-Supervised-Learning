# COMICS_Self_Supervised_Learning
Self Supervised Learning Algorithms trained on COMICS Dataset

## COMICS Dataset:

- [**Golden Age Comics**](https://digitalcomicmuseum.com/): Includes US comics between 1938 to 1956. The extracted panel images are used, which are retrieved through the study [The Amazing Mysteries of the Gutter](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05118).

## Implemented Models
- [DINO (Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino)
- [Swin Self Supervised Learning](https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Transformer-SSL)
- [MoCo v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04297)
- [Unsupervised Learning of Visual Representations by Solving Jigsaw Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09246)
